# Categories API

The Categories API allows you to traverse the many categories on **BESTBUY.COM** and perform product searches based on category names or identifiers. The Categories API also allows you to search for specific product attributes within a specific category (example: TVs less than $100), search using multiple product attributes within a specific category (example: TVs released in the last year that are less than $100) or look at Best Buy taxonomy to better search and present Best Buy product data (example: HD TVs released in the last year that are less than $100).

### Category and Subcategory Paths

As part of the category details, we provide a flat hierarchical path for each category. The `path` is a collection of all the categories in the path, starting with the root.

Similarly, the Subcategories path attributes provide a collection of subcategories for the parent category. Each category can have one or more subcategories associated to it, which are identified by subcategory ids and names.

_The Products API also includes the category path information for each product. For additional information on the category attributes in Products API, refer to [Categorizations.](/documentation/products-api#documentation/products-api-categorizations)_


## Common Attributes

**id** | Used to find all results within a specific category (e.g., abcat0100000)

  "total": 1,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "queryTime": "0.011",

        {
          "id": "cat00000",
          "name": "Best Buy"
        },
        {
          "id": "pcmcat128500050004",
          "name": "Name Brands"
        },
        {
          "id": "cat15063",
          "name": "Sony"
        },
        {
          "id": "pcmcat97200050015",
          "name": "Sony DSLR Camera"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The following query will return the category path for the category `name` specified in the input. In the below example we are requesting the category path for a **Sony DSLR Camera**. The query results are shown in a flat hierarchical path starting from the root. In this case **Best Buy** is the root category which is the first in the path, followed by its child category **Name Brands**, whose child is **Sony**, and its child **Sony DSLR Camera**, which is also the last category in this path.

# Products API

The Best Buy Product API provides a simple, REST-based interface for our entire product catalog, past and present. This includes pricing, availability, specifications, descriptions, and images for more than one million current and historical products. In addition, we offer full archives, updated daily, to make it easier to establish our full catalog locally. **Most product information is updated near real-time, including product pricing.**

*PLEASE NOTE: Music and movie data may be used only where an ability to purchase the related music or movies from BESTBUY.COM is provided to end users. Developers using music and movie data to redirect to BESTBUY.COM must become members of the Best Buy Affiliate Program to allow the sale of music and movies through BESTBUY.COM under the terms of the Affiliate Program.*

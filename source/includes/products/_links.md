## Links
The Links attributes provide a way for you to direct customers to a BESTBUY.COM product detail page or create a BESTBUY.COM cart on their behalf while including the product in the cart.

Attribute | Description
--------- | -----------
**addToCartUrl** | URL to BESTBUY.COM with item in cart
**url** | URL to BESTBUY.COM product detail page

<br>
For our **affiliate partners** we provide this same functionality but use a special link so you can get credit for your sale. Affiliates add their Impact Partner ID (IPID) to their query request. The URL generated will direct the customer to BESTBUY.COM with this item in their cart and credit the affiliate with the sale. <i>Additional information on the affiliate program can be found <a href="https://developer.bestbuy.com/affiliate-program" target="_blank">here</a>.</i>

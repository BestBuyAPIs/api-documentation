The Best Buy Stores API provides store information for all Best Buy stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. This information includes address, location, hours and services offered.

In addition, store availability of a product can be determined by querying the Products API together with the Stores API. Refer to In Store Availability for more information on these type of queries.

```

  console.log(data);
});
```

> Returns stores within 10 miles of ZIP code 55423 (Richfield, MN)

```json-doc
{
  "from": 1,
  "to": 2,
  "total": 22,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "totalPages": 11,
  "stores": [
    {
      "storeId": 2387,
      "storeType": "Mobile",
      "name": "Best Buy Mobile - Richfield"
    },
    {

  ]
}
```

The Stores API includes a special function `area(location,distance)` enabling you to locate stores near a specified location.

Use the `postalCode` attribute or a `lat`-`long` pair to search based on a location. When postal code is used the reference point in the postal code (zipcode) area is determined by a standard mapping service. If no distance is specified in the function, radius is defaulted to 10 miles. The `location` will be populated with the distance from the specified postal code or lat/long to the store in miles.

_Note_: _You may notice the stores returned are stated to be just over 10 miles from the ZIP code. This is due to the way return distance is calculated. The search area is defined as a square, bounded by location point +/- distance identified in request. All stores in that square are returned. Return distance is calculated linearly from the location point (creates a circle). Stores near the corner of the square might be listed as farther than the query distance specified._

The Hours attributes provide the days and times each Best Buy store is open for the following two weeks. We start our weeks on Sunday and provide hours in both a 12-hour and 24-hour clock. The times displayed are for the local time zones of the Best Buy store being returned. The Detailed Hours attributes provide the most accurate information of when stores will be opened or closed. This can be helpful during holidays as store hours may vary during this time.

*Hint: Detailed hours are filtered out from the search results by default. Query with `show=all` or `show=detailedHours` to see in the search results.*

The Stores API, in conjunction with the Products API, allows you to search stores for a product and identify if it is available. In-store availability searches will return only those stores that have a given product in stock. Stores not returned do not have that product in stock. When completing an in-store availability query you should limit the stores that are a part of the query.

Availability in stores is calculated using counts and previous-day sales to determine if the product is likely to be available, might be available or is unlikely to be available.  The algorithm errs on the side of caution, and anything that is not available defaults to "not available".

_HINT: The Products API attribute `inStoreAvailability` will tell you if a product is sold in stores but not if it's available at a particular store. Using the In-Store availability queries is equivalent to checking product availability in store._
